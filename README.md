# Hravé reflexy na doma

_„Malé krůčky, společný čas"_

A mobile app for parents of preschool children (about 4–6 years). It guides them through
short, regular movement exercises at home that support the integration of primary
(primitive) reflexes. The app UI is in Czech.

This is not a medical tool. It does not ask for or store any data about children.

## Status

**Phase 1: basic version.** The app runs on the device and stores data locally. Exercise
videos are bundled in the app. There is no backend, no login and no gamification yet. These
come in phase 2. See [docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md](docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md) for details.

## Getting started

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open the app in **Expo Go** on your phone (scan the QR code), or press `a` for Android.
Expo Go must support the project's SDK (58). The web version doesn't run yet.

Other commands:

```bash
npm run android    # start and open on Android
npm run ios        # start and open on iOS
npm run emulator   # start the Android emulator (Windows, scripts/emulator.ps1)
npx expo start --tunnel ngrok   # tunnel mode, when the phone is on a different network
```

On Windows PowerShell, if `npx` fails with "running scripts is disabled", use `npx.cmd`
instead.

To add a dependency, use `npx expo install <package>` so the version matches the Expo SDK.

## Tech stack
